# Scoreboard React (Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

This project was generated from an HTML prototype and converted into a React + Vite project.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Voice selection uses the browser SpeechSynthesis API; voices availability depends on the browser.
- Audio placeholders are in `public/audio/` â€” replace them with real mp3 files if you want sound effects.
